This project is a personal webpage that showcases my resume and portfolio. I used Next.js, a React framework, to create a static website with dynamic features. The website is deployed on two platforms: [Github Pages](https://ahkhodabakhsh.github.io/) and [Vercel](https://ahkhodabakhsh.vercel.app/). 


## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the project:

1. **Install the dependencies**: Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, install the project dependencies with the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

2. **Run the development server**: Start the development server with the following command. This will start the server, and you can view the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is busy).

```bash
  npm run dev
```

3. **Generate a full static production build**: When you're ready to deploy your app, generate a full static production build with the following command:

```bash
  npm run build
```

4. **Preview the site as it will appear once deployed**: After building the site, you can preview it with the following command. This will start a local server for you to preview your built site as it will appear once deployed.

```bash
  npm run serve
```

Remember, you need to push your changes to your GitHub repository and configure your deployment settings if you're deploying to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.
